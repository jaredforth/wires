# wires
A tiny DSL to solve the [Some Assembly Required](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/7) programming puzzle.

This is part of the excellent book [Beautiful Racket](https://beautifulracket.com/wires), which I would highly recommend checking out.

## Usage 

### Installing the package

- This requires [racket](https://download.racket-lang.org/)
- Clone this repository and `cd` into the `wires` directory
- Run `raco pkg install`

### Testing

- [test](test.rkt) confirms the syntax is working as expected
- [puzzle](puzzle.rkt) solves the actual puzzle using `wires`
